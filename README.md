Ask for a change; Dely takes it through design approval, implementation,
independent review, and a pull request you merge.

## Quickstart

Install Orca, then Dely.

1. Install the [desktop app](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/install).
2. Register the CLI (it ships with the app): Settings → General → Orca CLI.
   See the [CLI overview](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/cli/overview).
3. Enable orchestration: Settings → Experimental. See
   [orchestration](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/cli/orchestration).
4. Preflight:

```bash
orca open
orca status --json
orca orchestration run-list --json
```

`dely:delivery` stops if this preflight fails. On Linux the binary is
`orca-ide` (see the [install docs](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/install)).

Optional agent skills `orca-cli` and `orchestration`:
https://www.onorca.dev/docs/cli/skills

Then:

1. Install `dely` in the harness ([Install](#install)).
2. Open a session in the project.
3. Invoke `dely:setup` (optional).
4. Ask for a change.

## Project setup

In the project, invoke `dely:setup`.

It asks Quick (this harness for both phases) or Customize (pick harness,
model, and effort for `implement` and `review`), then writes one managed
block into `AGENTS.md`. Skip it and `dely:delivery` uses the current
harness and that harness's defaults.

## Install

The plugin is `dely`, from the `dely` marketplace at
`https://github.com/hieuphung97/dely.git`. The skill name is `delivery`;
invoke it as `dely:delivery`. The runtime needs Node 18 or newer on PATH.

Three harnesses are supported today: Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Cursor
Agent CLI. That list is not closed. `harnesses.json` at the repository
root carries four more as `deferred`: GitHub Copilot CLI, Antigravity
CLI, Grok Build, and Kiro CLI.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/hieuphung97/dely.git
claude plugin install dely@dely

claude plugin list                 # verify it is installed
claude plugin update dely          # update (restart required to apply)
claude plugin uninstall dely       # uninstall
```

A Claude Code Control was observed running `scripts/dely` straight out of
the marketplace source directory it was added from, not from
`~/.claude/plugins/cache`. A hash check that covers only the cache proves
nothing; it must cover every location that can serve the skill.

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/hieuphung97/dely.git
codex plugin add dely@dely

codex plugin list                  # verify it is installed
codex plugin marketplace upgrade   # update: see below
codex plugin remove dely@dely      # uninstall
```

`codex plugin marketplace add --ref <ref>` pins the marketplace to a tag
such as `v0.17.0` or an exact full commit SHA. There is no
`codex plugin update`: use `codex plugin marketplace upgrade`. Do not use
`codex plugin install`.

`codex plugin marketplace add` was observed keeping a stale marketplace of
the same name, installing the previous version, and reporting success. A
harness reporting a successful install is not evidence. To refresh, remove
the marketplace and the plugin, then add and install again.

### Cursor Agent CLI

```bash
cursor-agent plugin marketplace add https://github.com/hieuphung97/dely.git

# verify it is installed
cursor-agent plugin marketplace list

# re-index, no fetch
cursor-agent plugin marketplace update dely

# refresh: remove and re-add (remove drops the marketplace, not the plugin)
cursor-agent plugin marketplace remove dely
cursor-agent plugin marketplace add https://github.com/hieuphung97/dely.git
```

Cursor Agent CLI cannot install from a local snapshot:
`cursor-agent plugin marketplace add` takes a git URL only, and installing
what it indexes needs the interactive `/plugin` panel. It reads the Claude
plugin cache; a Cursor copy with a different hash wins over that cache.

The snapshot is addressed by commit, so `marketplace update` only re-indexes
and does not fetch. Remove and re-add the marketplace to pick up new commits,
then choose `Uninstall` from the `Installed` tab and install again from the
`Marketplace` tab of the `/plugin` panel.

Add the marketplace first with `cursor-agent plugin marketplace add`, then in
a Cursor Agent session type `/plugin` and press Enter. Open the `Marketplace`
tab, type `dely` in the search box, press Enter on `dely (dely)`, and choose
`Install for you (user scope)` (or `Install for all collaborators on this
repository (project scope)`).

To uninstall, open the `Installed` tab, select `dely`, and choose
`Uninstall`. `cursor-agent plugin marketplace remove` removes the marketplace
entry and leaves the plugin installed.

Type `/dely` to filter the palette to Dely's `/delivery` and `/setup`.

### Checked versions

These are the versions this README's commands were last locally checked
against — observations, not a promised minimum:

| Tool | Checked version |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | 2.1.273 |
| Codex CLI | 0.154.0 |
| Cursor Agent CLI | 2026.09.10-fd3934a |
| Orca | 1.4.203 |

## How Dely works

Ask for a change. Approve the design when asked. Dely implements, a
different session reviews, then opens a PR. You merge. A Spike investigates
only — no delivery run.

Control loads `orca skills get orchestration` and follows that supervised
loop. `dely preflight` runs in setup, and again after `NO_ACK`. After
`DISPATCHED`, Control waits by the harness Control wake: `background`
runs `dely wait`; `waker` runs `dely wait-bg` as its last command and
ends the turn. It never acts on an Orca nudge. `SETTLED` hands over the
batch; `ATTENTION` with a `nextAction` other than `none` runs the argv Orca
printed, and `ATTENTION` with `nextAction: none` and `requiresAction` means
the plane lost sight of the worker — check it, stop, abandon and release it,
then dispatch the same prompt file once more; `STALLED` is read then waited
or recovered; `NO_ACK` and `FAILED` retry once; `DEADLINE` is a checkpoint
(`worker-list` and last output; wait again if progressing; a second
`DEADLINE` with no progress goes to the human); `ERROR` goes to the
human.

The workflow contract is [`skills/delivery/SKILL.md`](skills/delivery/SKILL.md).

## Log

`~/.dely/log.jsonl` is machine-local JSON Lines, one object per line. It
is off unless `~/.dely/` exists; `mkdir ~/.dely` turns it on, and Dely
never creates that directory. A missing directory means nothing is
written and nothing is created.

The file may contain sensitive content. It quotes worker screen output
in full, so it can hold repository contents, error text, and whatever a
harness printed.

## Troubleshooting

- **`dely:delivery` stops immediately.** Orca is not running or a required
  capability is absent, including orchestration. Run the Quickstart
  preflight, then retry.
- **A stale skills copy shadows a newer plugin.** Codex also loads
  `~/.agents/skills`, and a copy left there — or a symlink to it from
  `~/.claude/skills` — wins over the plugin. Claude Code was observed
  running `scripts/dely` from the marketplace source directory, not from
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache`. Cursor Agent CLI reads the Claude plugin
  cache, and a Cursor copy with a different hash wins over it. Compare
  `skills/delivery/SKILL.md` by hash at every location that can serve the
  skill, including marketplace source directories, then update or remove
  the shadowing install. A harness reporting a successful install is not
  evidence of which copy ran; the hash is.
- **Codex still behaves the same after `codex plugin marketplace upgrade`.**
  Confirm the remote has new commits. A delivery already running keeps the
  plugin version from its start; open a new session after the upgrade.
- **`AGENTS.md` pins don't seem to apply in Claude Code.** Put
  `@AGENTS.md` in `CLAUDE.md`; Claude Code does not read `AGENTS.md`
  directly.
