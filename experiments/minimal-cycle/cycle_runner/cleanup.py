"""Destroying the run, and proving what was destroyed.

Two rules carry the weight. Destruction happens only after a confirmed
export, so evidence is never traded for tidiness. And destruction targets a
declared list of per-run resources, so a shared base image survives because
nothing was ever allowed to point at it, not because the command happened to
point elsewhere.
