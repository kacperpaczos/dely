"""Orca's own session inside the environment.

Orca's command line is a client: it reaches a runtime the desktop application
owns, and every orchestration command is sent *from* a terminal that runtime
knows. So before a worker can be dispatched, two things have to be true inside
the environment, and both are observed rather than assumed: the runtime reports
itself ready, and a coordinator terminal exists in the project copy.
